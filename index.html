    <h1>MiniWall Software Release - gh-pages branch</h1>
    <p>
      The MiniWall software is browser-based software that is used
      to analyze and understand large and small computationally and
      experimentally generated data sets.  The MiniWall software presents
      a matrix view of plots and other visualization images and provides
      a responsive and productive way to investigate the data and extract
      knowledge and understanding from it.  Since it is browser based,
      it runs on any computer or device that can display a web page.
      It can also be used remotely and securely by using web server
      software such as the Apache HTTP Server.
    </p>
    <p>
      The MiniWall software was originally written by John
      Melton in 2006 using a combination of HTML, JavaScript, and Microsoft's ActiveX
      software. Paul Stremel rewrote it in 2012 using modern JavaScript and HTML
      standards which enabled it to be run on non-Microsoft Windows-based
      computers.  Michael Schuh rewrote it in 2014 using JavaScript objects
      and extended the MiniWall software to have additional functionality
      that easily accommodates different usages. While it currently <b>works
      best with the Google Chrome</b> browser, it could be updated to run
      well under additional browsers such as Firefox, Internet Explorer,
      and Microsoft Edge.

           MiniWall below, you should be able to assess if a MiniWall would work for your
           application.
